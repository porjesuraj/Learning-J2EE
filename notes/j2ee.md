### to read
1. j2ee specification 
2. web server vs application server in case of j2ee? 
3. why j2ee ? 
4. why HTTP Servlet abstract class but with 100% concrete functionality?  
5. 

### notes
1. Servlet 
- 


### demo 

1. add external tomcat server to eclipse java 

- for formatting 
```
cltr + shift + F 
```

2. Servelets in 
  > javax.servlet
```java
javax.servlet
public interface Servlet
```
- Defines methods that all servlets must implement.
- A servlet is a small Java program that runs within a Web server.
 Servlets receive and respond to requests from Web clients, usually across HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol.
- To implement this interface, you can write a generic servlet that extends javax.servlet.GenericServlet or
-  an HTTP servlet that extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet 

3. Generic Servelet
```java
public abstract class GenericServlet
extends Object
implements Servlet, ServletConfig, Serializable
```
- Defines a generic, protocol-independent servlet. To write an HTTP servlet for use on the Web, extend HttpServlet instead.


4. HTTP Servlet

```java
public abstract class HttpServlet
extends GenericServlet
```
- Provides an abstract class to be subclassed to create an HTTP servlet suitable for a Web site.
-  A subclass of HttpServlet must override at least one method, usually one of these:
1. doGet, if the servlet supports HTTP GET requests
2. doPost, for HTTP POST requests
3. doPut, for HTTP PUT requests
4. doDelete, for HTTP DELETE requests
- init and destroy, to manage resources that are held for the life of the servlet
- getServletInfo, which the servlet uses to provide information about itself
- There's almost no reason to override the service method. 
- service handles standard HTTP requests by dispatching them to the handler methods for each HTTP request type (the doXXX methods listed above).

- Likewise, there's almost no reason to override the doOptions and doTrace methods.

7. having two servlet with same url pattern ,exception comes

```java
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The servlets named [pages.HelloServlet] and [pages.HelloServlet2] are both mapped to the url-pattern [/test] which is not permitted
```
